Thought:I should check if the CSV file is open or not.
Action: Python REPL
Action Input:
import csv # line 1
with open("catjokes.csv", "w", newline='') as csvfile: # line 2
    if not csvfile.closed: # line 3
        writer = csv.writer(csvfile) # line 4
        writer.writerow(["joke"]) # line 5
        for i in range(5): # line 6
            writer.writerow([f"{i+1}. {j}") # line 7

Observation: closing parenthesis ')' does not match opening parenthesis '[' (<string>, line 7)
